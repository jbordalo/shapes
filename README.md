# Shapes

First LAP practical project (P01).
<br>The aim of this project is to write a closed OCaml module named "Shape" containing a data representation for complex two-dimensional geometric shapes and the implementation of some functions over those shapes.

### Prerequisites

OCaml installed on the machine. Use:

`$ sudo apt-get install ocaml`

### Compiling
`$ ocamlc -c Shape.mli Shape.ml`

### Running

```
$ ocaml
    Objective Caml version 4.02.3
# #load "Shape.cmo";;
# open Shape;;
```
